# Code Coverage Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of code coverage for the XHarness project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies
- Added `coverlet.collector` version 6.0.0 to `Directory.Packages.props`
- Added `coverlet.msbuild` version 6.0.0 to `Directory.Packages.props`

### 2. Test Project Configuration
- Created `tests/Directory.Build.props` to automatically add Coverlet packages to all test projects
- This eliminates the need to manually add coverage packages to each test project

### 3. Coverage Configuration
- Created `tests/coverlet.runsettings` with optimized coverage settings:
  - Excludes test assemblies, xUnit, and Moq from coverage
  - Excludes generated code and compiler-generated code
  - Outputs in multiple formats (Cobertura, OpenCover, JSON)
  - Uses SourceLink for better source mapping
  - Skips auto-properties for cleaner reports

### 4. Coverage Scripts
- **`run-coverage.sh`** - Bash script for Linux/macOS
- **`run-coverage.ps1`** - PowerShell script for Windows
- Both scripts:
  - Run all tests with coverage collection
  - Output coverage results to `artifacts/coverage/`
  - Support configuration and format parameters
  - Provide instructions for generating HTML reports

### 5. Documentation
- **`docs/code-coverage.md`** - Comprehensive guide including:
  - Quick start instructions
  - Viewing options (HTML reports, VS Code extensions, CLI)
  - Manual execution commands
  - Configuration details
  - CI/CD integration examples (Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions)
  - Coverage thresholds
  - Troubleshooting guide
- Updated `README.md` with code coverage section

### 6. Git Configuration
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude coverage output files:
  - `coverage.json`
  - `coverage.cobertura.xml`
  - `coverage.opencover.xml`
  - `TestResults/` directory

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# macOS/Linux
./run-coverage.sh

# Windows
.\run-coverage.ps1
```

### With Parameters
```bash
# Run Release build with specific format
./run-coverage.sh Release cobertura
```

### View HTML Report
```bash
# Install ReportGenerator (one-time)
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

# Generate HTML report
reportgenerator \
  -reports:"artifacts/coverage/**/coverage.cobertura.xml" \
  -targetdir:"artifacts/coverage/report" \
  -reporttypes:Html

# Open report
open artifacts/coverage/report/index.html
```

## Current Coverage

Initial test run shows:
- **Line Coverage**: ~39.79%
- **Branch Coverage**: ~39.63%

This provides a baseline for tracking coverage improvements over time.

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **CI Integration**: Add coverage collection to Azure Pipelines
2. **Coverage Badge**: Add coverage badge to README
3. **Coverage Thresholds**: Enforce minimum coverage requirements
4. **Coverage Trends**: Track coverage changes over time
5. **Coverage Reports**: Publish reports to Azure DevOps or Codecov

## Files Modified

- `Directory.Packages.props` - Added Coverlet packages
- `.gitignore` - Added coverage output exclusions
- `README.md` - Added code coverage section

## Files Created

- `tests/Directory.Build.props` - Test project configuration
- `tests/coverlet.runsettings` - Coverage settings
- `run-coverage.sh` - Coverage script for Unix
- `run-coverage.ps1` - Coverage script for Windows
- `docs/code-coverage.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `COVERAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Restore packages successfully
- ✅ Run all test projects
- ✅ Generate coverage data in multiple formats
- ✅ Output results to `artifacts/coverage/`
- ✅ Properly exclude test assemblies from coverage

## Notes

- Coverlet version 6.0.0 is used (latest available in dotnet-public feed)
- Coverage data is generated per test project in separate directories
- Multiple output formats are generated simultaneously (Cobertura, OpenCover, JSON)
- Scripts are designed to work with XHarness's existing build infrastructure
